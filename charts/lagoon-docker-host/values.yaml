  # className sets the storageClassName for the docker-host PVC. This is
  # useful if the docker-host requires a specific storage class for features
  # such as increased IOPS.
  #
  # WARNING: On platforms such as AKS not all storage volume classes can be
  # bound to all node types. So if you configure a storage class that can't
  # be bound to any nodes in the cluster it will cause the docker-host pod to
  # fail to schedule. For example AKS requires Premium Storage suport on the
  # node for the managed-premium storage class.
  #
  # If className is not defined the chart will not set any specify storage
  # class on the PVC, effectively falling back to the cluster default.
