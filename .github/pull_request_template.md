<!--
NOTE: Pull requests making changes to a chart must also bump the version of the
chart as per Semantic Versioning.

https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#charts-and-versioning

In summary, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

<!--
Explain the **details** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?
